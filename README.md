1. Request message to sign: POST ```http://localhost:8000/requestValidation``` with POST payload: ```{"address": "BITCOIN WALLET ADDRESS"}```
2. Sign received message with your bitcoin wallet
3. Post signed message: POST ```http://localhost:8000/message-signature/validate``` with POST payload: ```{"address": " BITCOIN WALLET ADDRESS", "signature": "BITCOIN MESSAGE SIGNATURE"}```
